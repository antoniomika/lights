Lights
------

## A Python server for controlling lights

## How do I use this?

1. Make sure you have python and all of the dependencies (`sudo apt-get install python-smbus && pip install flask`)
2. Start the server (`python server.py`)

## Things to note:
- The server runs on port 8080 by default with Flask's debug mode enabled
- The server is standalone, meaning this script runs constantly
